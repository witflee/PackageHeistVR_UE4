# VR_Stealth_UE4

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

## Basic Game Premise

You play as a secret agent tasked with finding and stealing an important package from a heavily guarded warehouse. The guards patrol the warehouse in search of intruders, and you are armed with only your wits, so use whatever objects you find against them. You must use your environment to your advantage, using whatever means necessary to stay undetected as you complete your mission.

## Controls & System Information

Designed for use with the HTC Vive HMD and Vive controllers. Use the left trackpad to move around, pointing the left controller in the direction you want to go. Use the left and right edges of the right trackpad to instantly turn 45Â° in the selected direction. Use the triggers to grab and pick up objects.

## Gameplay

The player starts at a randomly selected entrance to the warehouse and must find the package, which has also been placed randomly around the warehouse. The guards patrol the warehouse on preset paths, moving in a predictable manner. The player will have a device on their wrist that shows a zoomed-in view of the surrounding walls and obects, the location of the guards and their field of vision, any security cameras and their field of vision, and any important objects such as the target object to steal and the entrance/exit to the warehouse. There will be a variety of hiding places and interactive objects around the warehouse, as well as many smaller objects that can be thrown at guards to temporarily stun them or knock them out. If a guard sees you, they will alert other guards nearby chase after you. While you are being chased, you will lose access to your wrist map and have to either quickly hide or take the guard down. If you are able to successfully evade or take out the guards chasing you, the remaining guards will return to their patrol paths, and you will regain access to your wrist map.

This game takes heavy inspiration from other media and video games, specifically "Metal Gear Solid" and "Budget Cuts." The gameplay combines elements of both: the dimly lit industrial facilities and guards with vision cones visible to the player from Metal Gear Solid, and the room-scale VR interactions and weapon-throwing from Budget Cuts.

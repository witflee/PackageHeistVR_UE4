# VR_Stealth_UE4

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

## Basic Game Premise

You play as an agent tasked with stealing a top secret package from a heavily guarded warehouse. Armed with only your wits, you must sneak into the warehouse and steal the package without being detected by the guards. Since you're going in unarmed, you will have to use your environment to your advantage, using whatever objects you find to aid you on your mission.

## System & Controls

This game was designed for use with the HTC Vive HMD and controllers. Use the left trackpad to move your character around, pointing the controller in the forwards direction. Use the edges of the right trackpad to instantly turn 45Â°. Use the triggers to pick up and grab objects. 

## Gameplay & Planned Features

The player starts in a random location at the edge of the warehouse and must make their way towards a target object (the package), which has also been randomly placed around the warehouse. Upon retrieval of the package, the player must then make their way back to the entrance they spawned at, all while avoiding the guards. The player has access to a minimap which shows their location, any guards and security cameras nearby, the vision cones of the previously mentioned guards and cameras, and any notable objects (entrances/exits, the package, etc). Should a player encounter a guard, the guard will drop what they're doing, chasing after the player. While being chased, the player will lose access to their minimap. If the player is able to break line of sight with the guards for long enough, the guards will return to what they were previously doing. If the player throws an object at one of the guards, they will be knocked out and can no longer chase the player.

## Inspiration

This game draws heavy inspiration from other media and video games, most notably "Metal Gear Solid" and "Budget Cuts." It incorporates the large, dim environments and minimap system from Metal Gear Solid, and the VR interactivity and throwable objects from Budget Cuts.
